## Usage

To use the GPTPalette extension, follow these steps:

1. Open the ChatGPT app in Google Chrome.

3. Choose a pre-defined theme from the list or create your own custom theme using CSS3.
4. Click the "Apply" button to apply the selected theme to the ChatGPT app.

## How it works

When a user selects a theme using GPTPalette, the extension applies the selected CSS styles to the ChatGPT app by modifying the HTML and CSS of the page. The extension uses JavaScript to dynamically update the styles of the page based on the selected theme.

The extension first retrieves the user's selected theme from the options page and stores it in a variable. It then updates the CSS styles of the ChatGPT app by modifying the `style` attribute of the relevant HTML elements.

For example, if the user selected a theme that changes the background color of the app to blue, the extension would modify the `style` attribute of the `body` element to include the CSS rule `background-color: blue;`. Similarly, if the user selected a theme that changes the font size of the app to 14px, the extension would modify the `style` attribute of the relevant text elements to include the CSS rule `font-size: 14px;`.

Once the styles have been updated, the ChatGPT app will reflect the new theme selected by the user.
